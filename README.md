## Introduction

### Background
Reservoir simulation is a computationally intensive process that requires significant time and resources. Traditional numerical simulation methods, while accurate, can take several days to complete a single scenario. This limitation becomes particularly challenging when multiple scenarios need to be evaluated for development planning and optimization.

### Objectives
- Develop a machine learning-based proxy model for fast reservoir simulation
- Identify key geological parameters influencing production
- Evaluate model performance and computational efficiency
- Provide actionable insights for reservoir development

## Methodology

### Data Generation and Preprocessing
- Synthetic dataset: 365,000 data points from 1,000 simulations
- Features: 8 geological and operational parameters
- Targets: 4 production parameters (oil rate, water cut, bottomhole pressure, water saturation)

### Model Architecture
Multiple machine learning models were implemented and compared:
- XGBoost (XGB)
- Random Forest (RF)
- Decision Tree (DT)
- Linear Regression (LR)

### Feature Engineering
Key features included:
- Porosity
- Horizontal permeability (kh)
- Vertical permeability (kv)
- Net-to-Gross ratio (NTG)
- Oil-water contact (OWC)

   - Risk: High spatial variability

2. **Net-to-Gross (NTG)**
   - Second most important parameter
   - High NTG zones preferred
   - Impact: Reservoir connectivity

3. **Permeability**
   - Limited individual impact of kh and kv
   - Negligible impact of kh/kv ratio
   - Recommendation: Focus on other parameters
